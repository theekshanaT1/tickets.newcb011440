    <h1>Green Turtle</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="greenturtlepara">The Sri Lankan green turtle (Chelonia mydas) is a species of sea turtle that is native to the coastal waters of Sri Lanka. They are one of the largest species of sea turtles, with adults reaching lengths of around 3 to 4 feet and weighing up to 500 pounds.

    These turtles are known for their distinctive green-colored carapace (shell), which helps them camouflage in their oceanic habitat. They have a streamlined body and powerful flippers, which enable them to swim long distances and dive to great depths in search of food.
    
    Sri Lankan green turtles are herbivorous, primarily feeding on seagrasses and algae. They play a crucial role in maintaining the health of coral reefs and seagrass beds by controlling the growth of these underwater plants.
    
    One of the most remarkable aspects of green turtles is their nesting behavior. Female green turtles return to the same beaches where they were born to lay their eggs, a behavior known as natal homing. They typically nest at night, digging deep holes in the sand to lay their clutch of around 100 to 200 eggs. The nests are then covered and left to incubate for approximately two months before the baby turtles hatch.

    <h1> Indian Star Tortoise</h1>
    <br>
    <p>The Indian star tortoise (Geochelone elegans) is a species of land tortoise known for its beautiful star-like patterns on its shell. While its native range includes India and Pakistan, the Indian star tortoise can also be found in Sri Lanka, where it has been introduced.

        In Sri Lanka, the Indian star tortoise typically inhabits dry and scrubland areas, including arid regions and thorny forests. It is a medium-sized tortoise, with adults averaging about 8 to 10 inches in length. Their domed carapace is characterized by intricate star-like patterns, consisting of yellow or beige lines radiating from a central point.
        
        These tortoises are herbivorous, feeding primarily on vegetation such as grasses, leaves, and flowers. They are known for their ability to withstand long periods without water, relying on the moisture obtained from their diet and burrowing to escape extreme heat.
        
        The Indian star tortoise is highly valued in the illegal pet trade due to its striking appearance. This, unfortunately, has resulted in significant population declines in their natural habitats. Additionally, habitat loss and degradation have further threatened their survival.
        
        Conservation efforts in Sri Lanka aim to protect the Indian star tortoise population and their habitats. These efforts include the establishment of protected areas, captive breeding programs, and initiatives to combat illegal trade. Public awareness campaigns also play a crucial role in educating local communities about the importance of conserving this species and the consequences of illegal trade.

    <h1> Logger Head Turtle</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) are a species of marine turtle known for their large heads and powerful jaws. While they are more commonly found in other regions around the world, such as the Mediterranean and North Atlantic, loggerhead sea turtles can also be spotted in Sri Lanka.

        In Sri Lanka, loggerhead sea turtles inhabit the coastal waters and nest on the sandy beaches. They are considered a migratory species, traveling long distances to reach their nesting grounds. Female loggerheads return to the same beaches where they were born to lay their eggs, a behavior known as natal homing.
        
        Loggerhead sea turtles are known for their strong swimming abilities and can dive to considerable depths to forage for food. They have a diet that primarily consists of bottom-dwelling invertebrates, such as crabs, mollusks, and jellyfish.
        
        The nesting season for loggerhead sea turtles in Sri Lanka typically occurs from November to February, during which female turtles emerge from the sea at night to lay their eggs. They dig deep nests in the sand and deposit an average of 100 to 120 eggs per clutch. The nests are then covered, and the eggs undergo a roughly two-month incubation period before the hatchlings emerge.
        
        However, like other sea turtle species, loggerheads face numerous threats in Sri Lanka. Coastal development, pollution, entanglement in fishing gear, and illegal harvesting of eggs and turtles are significant challenges to their conservation. Climate change and rising sea levels also pose risks to their nesting beaches.

            <li>Despite their name, green turtles do not have green shells. Instead, their shells are usually brown, olive, or black in color. However, their skin, especially on their head and limbs, can have a greenish tint due to the presence of algae that grows on their scales.</li> 
            <li>Beak-like Mouth: Green turtles have a unique beak-like mouth with a serrated edge, which helps them feed on seagrass and algae. This specialized structure allows them to graze and tear vegetation with efficiency.</li>
            <li> Green turtles are known for their extensive migratory behavior. They undertake long-distance migrations, traveling hundreds or even thousands of miles between their feeding grounds and nesting beaches.
