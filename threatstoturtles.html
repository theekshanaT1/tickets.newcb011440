<div class="threats1">
    <h1>Disease and Pollution</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="mainpara">Turtles are susceptible to various diseases, including fibropapillomatosis, a tumor-forming disease. Environmental pollution and habitat degradation can weaken turtles' immune systems, making them more susceptible to diseases and infections</p>
    <br>
    <h2>CONSEQUENCE</h2>
    <p class="para">Disease and pollution can result in increased mortality, impaired reproduction, reduced hatchling success, and altered sex ratios in turtle populations.</p>
    <h2>PREVENTION</h2>
    <P class="para">Prevention measures for disease and pollution in turtle populations include promoting habitat conservation, reducing pollution through proper waste management, implementing regulations to minimize fisheries bycatch, and raising awareness about the importance of responsible wildlife tourism.</P>

    <h1>Habitat Loss</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="mainpara"> Destruction and degradation of nesting beaches, coastal development, and loss of crucial feeding and nesting habitats pose significant threats to turtles. Urbanization, pollution, and coastal erosion can disrupt or destroy nesting sites, limiting their ability to reproduce.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>CONSEQUENCE</h2>
    <p class="para">Habitat loss has severe consequences for turtle populations. Destruction and degradation of nesting beaches and crucial feeding habitats significantly impact their ability to reproduce and find food. With the loss of nesting beaches due to coastal development and erosion, turtles face challenges in finding suitable areas to lay their eggs, leading to reduced nesting success and decreased population numbers.</p>
    <h2>PREVENTION</h2>
    <P class="para">Preventing habitat loss is crucial for the conservation of turtle populations. Efforts to preserve and protect nesting beaches and feeding habitats are essential. This can be achieved through implementing coastal management plans that prioritize the conservation of natural beach areas, minimizing coastal development, and regulating beachfront activities. Additionally, creating protected areas and marine reserves helps safeguard critical habitats for turtles. </P>

    <h1>Fisheries Bycatch</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="mainpara"> Turtles often become unintentionally caught in fishing gear such as nets, longlines, and trawls. This bycatch can result in injuries or fatalities, particularly for those species that need to come to the surface to breathe.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>CONSEQUENCE</h2>
    <p class="para">Fishery bycatch poses significant consequences for turtle populations. Turtles often become unintentionally caught in fishing gear such as nets, longlines, and trawls. This bycatch can result in injuries, drowning, or death, particularly for those species that need to come to the surface to breathe. The indiscriminate nature of fishing gear can lead to a high number of turtle fatalities, contributing to population decline. </p>
    <h2>PREVENTION</h2>
    <P class="para">Preventing fishery bycatch is vital for the conservation of turtle populations. Implementation of turtle-friendly fishing practices, such as the use of TEDs (Turtle Excluder Devices) in nets and circle hooks in longline fishing, helps reduce accidental turtle entanglement. Strict adherence to fishing regulations, including appropriate mesh sizes and seasonal fishing bans in critical turtle habitats, can also minimize bycatch.  </P>
